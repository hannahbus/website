**Model Multiplicity in Policy Learning** 

In policy learning, treatment rules are learned that map individual characteristics to treatment recommendations, aiding decision-making in fields like healthcare, education, and public policy. Policy rules are determined by choosing the model that performs best on training data, neglecting the issue of model multiplicity. Model multiplicity arises when multiple models are indistinguishable in terms of estimated performance but differ in structure and predictions. We introduce the concept of model multiplicity to the policy learning literature, along with formal measures to quantify its extent and individual-level welfare costs. Our integer programming approach is demonstrated with synthetic data and applied to two real-world scenarios: allocating individuals to training programs and prescribing tranexamic acid to trauma patients. We find model multiplicity and indication for adverse effects, calling into question the current practice of model selection in policy learning. We conclude that additional criteria for model selection need to be established if policy learning is to be deployed in high-stake applications where model multiplicity raises ethical and legal concerns.

**Optimal Policy Learning in Empirical Practice**
joint with Michael Lechner

This paper reviews, applies, and extends recently proposed methods for learning data-driven decision rules that exploit treatment effect heterogeneities. We juxtapose interpretable decision systems with black-box models, elucidating the trade-offs regarding explainability, vulnerability to misspecification, and computational complexity. We illustrate the application of policy learning methods through an assessment of training programmes. Our results offer practical insights for decision makers in pursuit of performant and trustworthy decision-making tools.
